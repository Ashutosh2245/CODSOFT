# 🎬 Movie Rating Analysis

This project is a comprehensive Python-based analysis of a movie dataset. It extracts meaningful insights from thousands of movie entries — including ratings, genres, votes, actors, and directors — and visualizes trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is a `.csv` file containing various attributes of movies such as:

- 🎞️ **Name**
- 📆 **Year**
- ⏱️ **Duration**
- 🎭 **Genre**
- ⭐ **Rating**
- 🗳️ **Votes**
- 🎬 **Director**
- 🎭 **Lead & Supporting Actors**

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📊 **Top 10 Highest Rated Movies**
- 🔥 **Top 10 Most Voted Movies**
- 🧑‍🎤 **Search Movies by Actor Name**
- 📈 **Genre Frequency Distribution**
- 🎯 **Average Rating by Genre**
- 🧼 Cleaned and Preprocessed for accurate insights

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- `Python`
- `Pandas` – Data manipulation
- `Matplotlib` – Static plotting
- `Seaborn` – Advanced visualization

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the script.
2. Place your movie `.csv` dataset in the same folder.
3. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
python movie_analysis.py
```

---

## 📸 Visual Outputs

The script will generate:

- Bar plots of **top rated** and **most voted** movies
- Distribution of **genres**
- Average **ratings by genre**

All charts are displayed inline for immediate insight.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Add **interactive filters** using `Streamlit` or `Tkinter`
- Export **PDF/HTML reports**
- Integrate **sentiment analysis** for user reviews
